# ENSF380Lab02

In order to run the code you need to cd into the directory that Application.java is stored. For me that is Lab02/src/ca/ucalgary/ensf380 as that is what I packaged it. \
From there run the command line
javac Application.java

then cd back to Lab02/src and run java ca.ucalgary.ensf380.Application

From there you have 5 options:

1. to view the current client information
2. to change any information regarding the client
3. view the pet information
4. change any information regarding the pet
5. Exit the program

from there you can play arround with the program and see that everything works
